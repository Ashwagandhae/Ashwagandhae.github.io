# Github pages
This is a repository that allows me to access Github Pages. 

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. You can see examples of GitHub Pages sites in the GitHub Pages examples collection.

You can host your site on GitHub's github.io domain or your own custom domain. For more information, see "Using a custom domain with GitHub Pages."

You can create GitHub Pages sites that are publicly available on the internet. Organizations that use GitHub Enterprise Cloud can also publish sites privately by managing access control for the site. For more information, see "Changing the visibility of your GitHub Pages site" in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation.

To get started, see "Creating a GitHub Pages site."

Organization owners can disable the publication of GitHub Pages sites from the organization's repositories. For more information, see "Managing the publication of GitHub Pages sites for your organization."

There are three types of GitHub Pages sites: project, user, and organization. Project sites are connected to a specific project hosted on GitHub, such as a JavaScript library or a recipe collection. User and organization sites are connected to a specific account on GitHub.com.

To publish a user site, you must create a repository owned by your personal account that's named <username>.github.io. To publish an organization site, you must create a repository owned by an organization that's named <organization>.github.io. Unless you're using a custom domain, user and organization sites are available at http(s)://<username>.github.io or http(s)://<organization>.github.io.

The source files for a project site are stored in the same repository as their project. Unless you're using a custom domain, project sites are available at http(s)://<username>.github.io/<repository> or http(s)://<organization>.github.io/<repository>.
